        Hey there! My name is <span style="font-style: italic;">moscowmule1776</span>,
        I am a junior at Brown concentrating in computer science with a focus on
        systems and security. I'm very passionate about the automotive industry
        and enjoy developing products for vehicles both on the software and
        hardware side of things. Outside computer science, working on, modifying,
        and racing cars are the main things I do during my free time!

            For this UI/UX assignment, students were tasked with creating an interactive interface using interface components, and tying them to an internal data state, with an emphasis on functionality and usability. I developed a drag racing results page with filter, sort, and aggregation functionality built with React JS.

            The website parses and renders JSON data of different cars with different engines (V6, V8, V10, I5, I6) and induction methods (supercharged, turbocharged, naturally aspirated), allowing them to be sorted in order by fastest 1/4 mile trap speed or elapsed time.
            In drag racing, elapsed time is the time it takes a vehicle to accelerate from a stop and travel a certain distance (1/4 mile in this case), and trap speed is the speed at which the vehicle is traveling at the time it reaches the specific distance.

The interactive menu on the left hand side of the screen utilizes different colors to show the state of selected items, and the content view made up by cards of each car takes up the remaining right hand side of the screen.
